The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 so Steve can determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing

The Data
The data that is presented includes two charts with stock information on 12 different stocks from 2017 and 2018. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

The Advantages of Refactoring Stock Analysis
The biggest benefit that occurred as a result of the refactoring was an decrease in macro run time
